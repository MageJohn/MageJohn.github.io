I'm a 16 year old girl who loves to make things!  My brother made me this website for Christmas so that I can use it to showcase my Silver Arts Award and perhaps launch a business from it in future.  It will also be a place for me to start a blog!  

I came up with my online name when I was about nine years old.  I needed a username for a forum about one of my favourite book series, Chronicles of Ancient Darkness by Michelle Paver,  so I combined the names of the leading girl, Renn, with a painting I'd seen with the word Ravenwood in the tile.  I played around with it a little until I got Renna of Ravenwood, it just clicked!  I've been using variations of it ever since.

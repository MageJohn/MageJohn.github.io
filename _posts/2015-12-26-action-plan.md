Here's where I'm putting my action plan(s).  It took a couple of revisions to get one I could actually follow, but here they are :)

  The first one is from when I was still going to do an oil still life as my challenge.  It wasn't quite finished when I swapped to wire but here it is anyway:

  Then came my first one on wire jewellery making.  It looks nice but I gave myself far too little time to do each thing!

  My third one would have been doable, if only I hadn't had to move house right in the middle of it!

  Oh well, all I had to do was shift the dates along a bit.
